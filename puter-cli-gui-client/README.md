## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Puter CLI installed globally (`npm install -g puter-cli`)
- Puter account (sign up at https://puter.com)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you want to use API key authentication:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your PUTER_API_KEY
```

3. Make sure you're logged in to Puter CLI:
```bash
puter login
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/puter-gui-v2.html
```

## Usage

### Authentication
The GUI automatically uses your Puter CLI authentication. Make sure you're logged in via `puter login` before using the GUI.

### Creating Workers
1. Click on the "⚙️ Workers" tab
2. Enter a worker name
3. Write your worker code (JavaScript with router API)
4. Click "Create & Deploy Worker"
5. Wait 5-30 seconds for propagation

Example worker code:
```javascript
// Simple GET endpoint
router.get('/api/hello', async (event) => {
    return 'Hello, World!';
});
```

### Managing Apps
1. Click on the "📱 Applications" tab
2. Create new apps with custom names and descriptions
3. View app statistics and usage
4. Update or delete existing apps

### Static Sites
1. Click on the "🌐 Static Sites" tab
2. Create sites with custom subdomains
3. Deploy from local directories
4. Manage all your hosted sites

## Known Limitations

⚠️ **File Operations Not Available**
File management commands (ls, mkdir, rm, etc.) are not supported on Windows due to a known bug in the Puter CLI interactive shell. Please use the Puter web interface at https://puter.com for file operations.

⚠️ **Delete Operations Use Force Flag**
All delete operations (apps, sites) automatically use the `-f` (force) flag to bypass confirmation prompts. This is a workaround for a Puter CLI bug where inquirer confirmation prompts break stdin in shell mode, causing the CLI to become unresponsive.

⚠️ **Puter CLI Performance Issues**
The Puter CLI has known performance issues with `rm` and `pull` commands due to `findMatchingFiles` recursively traversing the entire filesystem. These commands should only need the absolute file path, not recursive traversal. This is a Puter CLI design issue, not specific to this GUI. For better performance, use the Puter web interface or SDK for file operations.
